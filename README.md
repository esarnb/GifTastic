## Getting Started

To run this on your local machine, you may download all folders and the index.html. Open the index.html with your preferred browser to initialize the website.

You must have an internet connection to load certain back-end magical things! 

### Installing

To deploy on a live system, such as your website, you will need a web server [like Apache2 for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Then place the folders and files in the subfolder of your choice within the html root directory.
